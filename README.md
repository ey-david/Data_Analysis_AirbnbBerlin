# Data_Analysis_AirbnbBerlin
A study done using Python and Tableau to analyze data from insideairbnb.com

## Objectives 

The objectives of this study are: 

1. Determine the factors of Airbnb pricing and rating in Berlin 

2. Observe changes in Airbnb listings based on a March 2023 Airbnb announcement requiring listings to have a license from the authorities

3. Observe price changes in local rental costs vs. Airbnb

## Background 

Berlin has had an adversarial relationship with Airbnb, enacting a law in 2016 which barred almost all landlords from renting their apartments to short-term visitors. Although overturned in 2018, Berlin remained highly restrictive on allowing landlords to rent out properties that are not their primary residence and has required hosts to use a registration number. 

A 2021 study by the German Institute for Economic Research found that the rental cost of an apartment in Berlin increases if there are long-term Airbnb rentals available in their area, indicating that Airbnb does drive up local housing costs. 

In October 2022, Airbnb announced that that starting in March 2023 they would require anyone listing an apartment or room to have a registration number from their relevant district authority, among other rules, so that authorities can recognize unfair offers and uphold regulations for fair rental contracts.

The data used for this study was taken from insideairbnb.com, a website which scrapes information from Airbnb listings once per quarter with some limitations. The period studied is September 2022â€“June 2023.
